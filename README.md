# # PRAGMA // Workbench

PRAGMA is a purpose-built operational workspace, not a general note app. At its core it is a focused Markdown editor with session/target structure, a right-side knowledge context panel, and fast capture of evidence/loot during an engagement. The design keeps you in the note flow while pulling in KB, tactics, and search context only when needed.

---
## 🚩 My Problem

Pentest workflows are fragmented — notes, findings, and knowledge live in different places, breaking focus and increasing cognitive load. Generic note tools lack structure, reporting platforms are too rigid, and cloud solutions add risk.

## ❌ What it is NOT

- **Not a reporting tool** — notes are for operational use, only drafts and not deliverables
- **Not a team platform** — single-operator, local-first by design
- **Not a scanner, exploit framework or automation platform** — it does not touch your targets or automate any scanning or exploitation
- **Not cloud-dependent** — everything runs locally on your machine, and nothing leaves it


## ✅ What it IS

- **A local web application** — PRAGMA runs entirely on your machine, combining structured note-taking with a searchable knowledge base
- **A workflow workbench** — built to support the natural flow of a penetration test, from initial access to post-exploitation with findings, without breaking focus
- **A knowledge-integrated interface** — local KB search is built in, and ENGRAM integration is optional for searching indexed external sources from inside the app

## 👤 Who This Is For

PRAGMA exists because this is the workflow I wanted for myself.

It is not trying to solve everybody else's note-taking, reporting, or engagement-management problem. It is opinionated, local-first, and built around how I prefer to work during an assessment. If that fits your way of operating, use it. If it does not, do not.

That is intentional. The goal is not to be universal. The goal is a better structured workflow.

## 🗂️ Workspace Model

PRAGMA is structured in three levels:

- **Workbench** — the local workspace on your machine. A single workbench can contain multiple sessions.
- **Session** — an engagement, project, machine set, or working context. A session can contain one target or many.
- **Target** — a concrete IP, domain, or labeled host entry inside a session.

This means PRAGMA does not force one workflow:

- one workbench can hold several parallel engagements
- one session can represent a single machine
- one session can also represent a broader engagement with multiple targets

Titles and note content stay flexible, while session assignment and target assignment provide the explicit structure.

## 🎯 Focus Model

PRAGMA is built around a simple interaction rule:

- **Session Notes are the primary workspace** during an engagement
- **Knowledge Base, Tactics, search, and quick-log are supporting tools**
- supporting views should help you retrieve context, not pull you out of the note-taking flow unnecessarily

In practice, this means the app is opinionated about staying operational:

- notes are where active engagement context lives
- services, tactics, and indexed KB content are there to support the current note/work, not replace it
- when possible, supporting content should open beside the current note rather than forcing a full context switch

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Area | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js | App server and local runtime |
| Backend | Express | API routes, static assets, and EJS view serving |
| Templating | EJS | Server-rendered app shell and partials |
| Frontend | Vanilla JavaScript | Modular browser scripts under `public/app/` |
| Editors | CodeMirror 6 | Markdown editing for notes and KB content |
| Markdown Rendering | `marked` | KB and server-side markdown rendering |
| Search | Fuse.js | Local fuzzy search and KB relevance scoring |
| Encryption | Web Crypto API | Client-side AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2-SHA-512 |
| Storage | File-backed JSON + Markdown | Sessions/workbench state on disk, KB as `.md` files |
| Containerization | Docker / Docker Compose | Optional local container runtime |

## 🏷️ Features

**Sessions & Targets**
- Named sessions with multi-target tracking (IP, domain, label)
- Session-level attacker IP field for callback/reverse-shell style placeholders
- Active target auto-injects into all code blocks at copy time across the KB and tactics
- Session status tracking (Active / Paused / Complete) with timeline view
- Export/import sessions as JSON for portability; session exports also support structured markdown bundles and a consolidated markdown export

**Encryption**
- Full workbench encryption (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA-512, 600k iterations) — client-side only
- Server stores ciphertext; password never touches disk, localStorage, or the network
- Workbench file is portable — moving to another machine is a file copy

**Notes**
- Typed notes with structured markdown templates — see [Note Templates](#-note-templates) below
- Note templates support per-template variants, so one template type can expose multiple predefined workflows or note layouts
- Full-text search across note titles and bodies, with type/tag/target/scope filters
- Tags, pin, auto-save, duplicate, and per-note `.md` export
- Drag-and-drop and clipboard image support in notes; pasted or dropped screenshots are stored as note attachments and inserted as standard markdown images
- Session summary export supports a consolidated markdown file and an optional PDF summary output
- Session reassignment, target assignment, and Timeline view for chronological activity
- Checklist support (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) in preview with live sync-back to source
- Tool output parser — paste raw output from `nmap`, `masscan`, `gobuster` and similar tools directly into notes with structured formatting
- In-app editing of `note-templates.json` through the Configuration section, using the same editor/autosave flow as notes

**Quick Log (`Ctrl+L`)**

A persistent in-session capture tool accessible from the topbar:

- **Ports** — log open ports and services manually or by pasting raw output from `nmap`, `rustscan`, or `masscan`. Parsed automatically into structured rows (port, proto, service, version, notes)
- **Paths** — log web paths from directory and vhost enumeration. Accepts raw output from `gobuster`, `ffuf`, and `dirbuster`, or manual entry with optional HTTP status code
- **Loot** — log credentials, hashes, tokens and keys found during the engagement. Each entry has a type tag (Cleartext / Hash / Token / Key / Other), a host field (auto-filled from the active target), and a context note. Credentials are click-to-copy
Ports, paths, and loot persist per session alongside notes. Ports and credentials can also sync into structured notes such as `Network Enumeration` and `Credentials`, reducing duplicate capture.

**TODO**

A session-wide checkbox list for next steps, kept alongside the session so unfinished tasks persist across reloads and later reopen.

**Evidence**

PRAGMA also includes a dedicated Evidence workflow for preserving proof directly from session notes, rather than retyping it into a second table.

- **Selection-driven capture** — select a command, line, or markdown block in the note editor and use **Add as Evidence**
- **Typed evidence entries** — supported categories include Enumeration, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Pivoting, Collection, Exfiltration, Cleanup, and Proof
- **Source-linked tracking** — each Evidence entry stays linked to the original note and supports jumping back to the exact flagged source block
- **Optional Loot creation** — when adding Evidence, you can also create a Loot entry from the same selection and optionally sync cleartext/hash material into the `Credentials` note
- **Evidence management** — the Evidence panel supports filtering by type and target, inline editing, and unflagging while keeping the original note content
- **Clean markdown export** — Evidence markers are used internally in notes, but are stripped from exported markdown/session exports so generated files stay readable

This makes Evidence the primary workflow for preserving proof from notes, while Loot remains the specialized structured store for credentials, tokens, keys, and similar material.

**Knowledge Base & Tactics**
- Indexes local `.md` files from `knowledge_base/` with three distinct surfaces: `knowledge_base/services/` feeds the Services view, `knowledge_base/tactics/` feeds the Tactics view, and other top-level folders become standalone KB sections
- Editable in-UI with live disk write-back and auto re-index on change
- Every code block and inline backtick span is click-to-copy with target IP injected
- Full-text search with weighted relevance scoring, fuzzy matching, and per-result match type (exact / fuzzy / partial)
- Local/remote scope filter, source filter, and query-term snippet highlighting in results
- Degrades gracefully if ENGRAM is offline, with a one-click reachability check
- Local KB previews support quick switching between sibling notes in the same category/folder

**Workbench Reliability**
- Atomic writes — every save is written to a temp file first, then renamed into place, preventing corruption from crashes or power loss
- Rolling backups — the last 5 versions of your workbench are kept automatically in `sessions/backup/`
- Automatic fallback recovery — if the live workbench file is corrupt or missing, PRAGMA silently loads from the most recent valid backup
- Startup integrity check — on every start, PRAGMA logs the workbench state, backup count, and any issues detected

**Interface**
- Command palette (`⌘K`), keyboard shortcuts for all major actions, dark/light mode
- Quick Log (`Ctrl+L`) — see above

## 📝 Note Templates

PRAGMA supports built-in note templates. Each opens with a pre-structured markdown body, relevant default tags, and a title prefix to keep notes consistent across engagements.

Templates can also define **variants**. A single template type can expose multiple selectable versions in the new-note flow, each with its own title prefix, default tags, and markdown body. This is useful when one note category needs several operating modes, for example:

- an OSCP template with separate `Exam Target`, `Practice`, and `AD Workflow` variants
- a Credentials template with different layouts for general credentials vs AD credentials
- a Recon template with different structures for web, network, or cloud-focused recon

| Template | Icon | Default Tags | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General** | 📋 | — | Free-form notes with Overview / Notes / References sections |
| **Credentials** | 🔑 | `creds` | Credential table, password spray notes, valid sessions |
| **Recon** | 🔭 | `recon` | Target overview, open ports, web endpoints, DNS, users |
| **Network Enumeration** | 🌐 | `network` | Per-target target overview plus synchronized open ports and services |
| **PrivEsc** | ⬆ | `privesc` | System info, enumeration checklist, vectors tried, escalation path |
| **Loot** | 💰 | `loot` | Exfiltrated files, credentials found, flags/proofs |
| **Exploit** | 💥 | `exploit` | CVE/CVSS metadata, payload, steps, outcome, cleanup |

### Custom Templates (`note-templates.json`)

You can extend or fully replace the built-in templates by editing `note-templates.json` next to `server.js`. PRAGMA exposes this directly in the app under `Configuration -> Note Templates`, and also loads the same file on startup as the source of templates.

**Schema:**

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "id": "tunneling",
      "label": "Tunneling",
      "icon": "🕳️",
      "title_prefix": "Tunnel",
      "default_tags": ["tunneling", "pivot"],
      "body_lines": [
        "## Setup",
        "",
        "## Listeners",
        "",
        "## Routes",
        ""
      ],
      "variants": [
        {
          "id": "ligolo",
          "label": "Ligolo",
          "title_prefix": "Tunnel",
          "default_tags": ["tunneling", "pivot", "ligolo"],
          "body_lines": [
            "## Listener",
            "",
            "## Agent",
            ""
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | ✅ | Unique identifier, lowercase, no spaces |
| `label` | ✅ | Display name shown in the template picker |
| `icon` | — | Emoji shown on the note type badge |
| `title_prefix` | — | Prepended to the note title on creation |
| `default_tags` | — | Array of tags automatically applied to the note |
| `body` | — | Initial markdown content for the note body as a single JSON string |
| `body_lines` | — | Multi-line template body as an array of strings; joined with `\n` on load |
| `variants` | — | Array of selectable template variants. Each variant can define its own `id`, `label`, `icon`, `title_prefix`, `default_tags`, `body`, or `body_lines` |

Use either `body` or `body_lines`. `body_lines` is easier to read and maintain for longer markdown templates.

If `variants` are present, PRAGMA shows a second selection step in the note-creation flow. The chosen variant becomes the note's starting layout and can override the parent template's defaults.

Custom templates appear in the picker with a purple border and a **Custom** heading to distinguish them from built-ins. If the file is missing, malformed, or empty, PRAGMA falls back to the built-in templates silently.

### Images in Notes

Notes also support pasted and dropped screenshots/images.

- Paste a copied screenshot directly into the editor with `Ctrl+V`
- Drag a local image file into the editor
- PRAGMA stores the image as a note attachment and inserts standard markdown image syntax automatically:

```md
![image](/api/notes/attachments/<note-id>/<filename>)
```

This keeps image handling compatible with normal markdown preview/rendering while still using PRAGMA's note-scoped attachment storage.

## 🔐 Security

PRAGMA is a single-operator, localhost-first tool. It is designed for use on a controlled machine, ideally a dedicated pentest VM.

High-level security position:

- binds to `127.0.0.1` by default
- supports encrypted workbench storage with client-side AES-256-GCM
- treats imported/session/markdown content as untrusted input
- is not intended for hostile internet-facing multi-user deployment

For the actual threat model, mitigations, verified checks, and remaining review areas, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## 🎯 Target Injection Reference

When a session has an active target set, PRAGMA automatically replaces placeholder variables in KB documents and tactics with the target's IP and domain — highlighted in yellow on render, and injected at copy time in code blocks.

Write your KB docs using any of the supported placeholder styles below.

### IP / Host → Active Target IP

| Style | Supported placeholders |
|---|---|
| Angle brackets | `<IP>` `<ip>` `<TARGET>` `<TARGET_IP>` `<target_ip>` `<RHOST>` `<rhost>` `<HOST>` `<host>` `<MACHINE_IP>` |
| Shell variables | `$IP` `$RHOST` `$TARGET` `$TARGET_IP` `$HOST` |
| Curly braces | `{IP}` `{ip}` `{RHOST}` `{rhost}` `{TARGET}` `{HOST}` `{host}` |
| Double curly | `{{ip}}` `{{IP}}` `{{target}}` `{{rhost}}` `{{host}}` `{{HOST}}` |
| Bare words | `TARGET_IP` `TARGET_IP_ADDRESS` `RHOST` `TARGET` `MACHINE_IP` |
| HTB-style literals | `10.10.10.X` `10.10.X.X` |
| Backtick-scoped only | \`IP\` \`HOST\` — injected **only inside inline code**, not in plain prose |

### Domain / FQDN → Active Target Domain

| Style | Supported placeholders |
|---|---|
| Angle brackets | `<DOMAIN>` `<domain>` `<TARGET_DOMAIN>` `<FQDN>` `<fqdn>` `<DC>` `<dc>` `<WORKGROUP>` |
| Shell variables | `$DOMAIN` `$FQDN` `$DC` |
| Curly braces | `{DOMAIN}` `{domain}` `{FQDN}` |
| Double curly | `{{domain}}` |
| Bare words | `TARGET_DOMAIN` `DOMAIN` `WORKGROUP` |

> **Note on bare `IP` and `HOST`:** These are common English words, so global replacement would cause false positives in prose. PRAGMA only injects them when wrapped in backticks — e.g. `` `nmap -sV IP` `` or `` `curl HOST/api` `` — leaving sentences like *"Enter the target IP"* untouched.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- **Optional:**
  - Docker and `docker compose`
  - [ENGRAM](https://github.com/VJakoby/engram) — required only if you want search of indexed online sources

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for the full project directory structure, volume mounts, and how to run PRAGMA with an external ENGRAM instance over a shared Docker network.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for full Docker instructions.

Recommended Docker workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create a local env file
cp .example.env .env

# 2. Edit .env and point PRAGMA_KB_PATH to your local knowledge base
#    (and PRAGMA_SESSIONS_PATH if you want runtime data somewhere else)

# 3. Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# 4. Access at
http://localhost:3000
```

Common `.env` values include:

- `PRAGMA_KB_PATH`
- `PRAGMA_SESSIONS_PATH`
- `PRAGMA_UID`
- `PRAGMA_GID`
- `SEARCH_URL`

If you edit `note-templates.json` on the host and want those changes reflected inside Docker without rebuilding, add a bind mount for that file as described in [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md).

### Running manually with Node.js
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the server
npm start

# 3. Open in browser
http://localhost:3000
```

## Frontend Layout

The live UI is rendered from [views/app.ejs](./views/app.ejs). The older [public/app.html](./public/app.html) is kept as a static mirror/reference page, but the server-rendered EJS view is what the application actually serves.

The frontend is now split into smaller browser modules under [public/app](./public/app):

- `shell.js` — theme, sidebar state, app bootstrap, global shortcuts, view switching
- `content-panel.js` — KB/tactics preview rendering, copy helpers, source preview panel
- `editor-theme.js` — shared editor state and syntax theme handling
- `note-editor.js` — note editor initialization and preview layout behavior
- `kb-editor.js` — in-place KB/tactics editing logic
- `workbench.js` — workbench/session storage, encryption flow, template loading
- `notes.js` — note CRUD, filters, tags, targets, exports
- `quick-log.js` — ports, paths, loot, and the topbar quick-log popover
- `timeline.js` — timeline view, chronology rendering, toast helpers, shared timeline helpers
- `kb.js`, `search.js`, `targets.js` — KB browsing, search integration, target management
- `app.js` — remaining app coordinator logic, command palette, and modal helpers

This means most new frontend work should target one of those focused modules instead of growing `app.js` back into a monolith.
